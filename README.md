Tween
=====

A C++ library for time-based and frame-based tweening

## Basic Usage

### Tween Module

### Easing Module

An easing is given as a specialization of `takram::easing::EasingGroup`, in which `In`, `Out` and `InOut` static functors wrap the easing function. An easing function will be invoked with an unit time `t`, which is normalized between 0.0 and 1.0, andreturn the corresponding normalized value for `t`. To make your own easing, write a function that takes `t`, then define a specialization:

```cc
inline double Ease(double t) {
  return /* Write your own logic */;
}
using Easing = takram::easing::EasingGroup<Ease>;

```

This enables you to make use of ease-in, ease-out and ease-in-out out of your easing function.

```cc
// Given:
T value;
const T to;
const double duration;

// Then:
takram::Tween<>(&value, to, Easing::In, duration);
takram::Tween<>(&value, to, Easing::Out, duration);
takram::Tween<>(&value, to, Easing::InOut, duration);
```

The pre-defined easings are derived from [Robert Pennerâ€™s Easing Functions](http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/) listed below:

- [`takram::BackEasing`](include/takram/easing.h)
- [`takram::BounceEasing`](include/takram/easing.h)
- [`takram::CircularEasing`](include/takram/easing.h)
- [`takram::CubicEasing`](include/takram/easing.h)
- [`takram::ElasticEasing`](include/takram/easing.h)
- [`takram::ExponentialEasing`](include/takram/easing.h)
- [`takram::LinearEasing`](include/takram/easing.h)
- [`takram::QuadraticEasing`](include/takram/easing.h)
- [`takram::QuarticEasing`](include/takram/easing.h)
- [`takram::QuinticEasing`](include/takram/easing.h)
- [`takram::SinusoidalEasing`](include/takram/easing.h)

## Setup Guide

Run "setup.sh" inside "scripts" directory to initialize submodules and build dependant libraries.

### Submodules

- [cpplint](https://github.com/sgss/mirror-cpplint)
- [gflags](https://code.google.com/p/gflags/)
- [glog](https://github.com/sgss/mirror-glog)
- [gtest](https://github.com/sgss/mirror-googletest)

## Style Guide

This project tries to conform to [Google's C++ Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml) except:

- Use of lambda expressions
- Use of exceptions in exceptional cases
- Use of streams when strongly needed for convenience
- Naming convention of non-inline functions
